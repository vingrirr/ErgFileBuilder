# ThibaultMAPErgFileBuilder

A C# implementation of Guy Thibault's model for generating high intensity interval workouts based on an athlete's Max Aerobic Power. 
More information on the model can be found here: http://coachr.org/a_graphical_model_for_interval.htm

This project can output a series of workouts in the .erg file format which can be used on smart trainers.
